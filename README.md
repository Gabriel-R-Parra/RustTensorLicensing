# RustTensorLicensing
## Purpose
A parallel processing implementation of a Tensor (inspired by PyTorch) that can effectively compute the back propagation of a Neural Network. 
This project is a personal project that aims to teach myself and others (who might be interested) how Neural Networks work. Provided is a rust implementation that allows
people to mess around with it and make imporvements to the project.
